This guide is oriented for tune Install BlackArch just if you have Manjaro, Archlinux, Antergos, or arch derivated distro execute:
#
su
#
cd Downloads 
#
whet http://blackarch.org.strap.sh
#
chmod +x strap.sh
#
./strap.sh
#
Reply the questions of the wizard as per you pefrerence or needs.
$
Don't forget create the secondary account during the installation with administrative rights, don't work with root  as your main account.
#
Now if you are installing from the scracth usin the original ISO of Blackarch, follow this steps:
#
#
1. The perfect cocktail is play with the repos: blackarch + antergos + arch with pr1v8 DNS's from Parrot Security OS, instead of use your ISP and google, with Round Robin feature.
#
Just lookup for installedthe below needed files at
#
https://github.com/4k4xs4pH1r3/blackarch/tree/master/docs
#
Â» Make a backup of the existents files and replace as below:
#
# 
pacman.conf         (replace at directory: /etc/)
# 
resolv.conf         (replace at directory: /etc/)
# 
antergos-mirrolist  (replace at directory: /etc/pacman.d/)
# 
blackarch-mirrolist (replace at directory: /etc/pacman.d/)
# 
mirrolist           (replace at directory: /etc/pacman.d/)
# 
gpg.conf            (replace at directory: /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/)
# 
pubring.gpg         (replace at directory: /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/)
# 
trustdb.gpg         (replace at directory: /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/)


#
So the next step, is tune network interfaces; dhcp; wicd; d-bus & NetworkManager. . 

#
## For that  execute this commads from your terminal as root

#
rm -r /var/run/wicd/wicd.pid
#
systemctl enable wicd.service
#
systemctl start wicd.service
#
systemctl status wicd.service

# 
Now let's identify if your network is ready and the interface names with the below commands

#
lspci | grep -i net
#
iwconfig
#
ip link

#
cd /etc/netctl 
#
cp examples/ethernet-static my-network

#
nano my-network

And change the Interface from eth0 to enp19s0 (or whatever your adapter is in ip link).
Finally, I enabled it to use that profile on startup with
#
netctl enable my-network

#
In my case my system reported the below for ethernet: enp19s0, and for wireless: wlp18s0b1

#
ip link set enp19s0 up
#
ip link set wlp18s0b1 up

#
Just in case that from blackarch wm you can't conenct to internet with the both options embedded in this distro, go to your terminal and execute:
#
wifi-menu
#
systemctl enable networkmanager.service
#
systemctl start networkmanager.service
#
systemctl status networkmanager.service

#
Ok, is time to up both interfaces, for that execute this sequence
#
dhcpcd enp19s0
#
dhcpcd wlp18s0b1

#
Now upgrade your system and add deepin & gnome as your wm's
#
pacman -Syuu
#
reboot

#Verify that all the packages of BlackArch are really installed and Upgraded
#
pacman -Syy blackarch --needed --force
#
reboot

3. Use the combo pamac + octopi + yaourt + pacaur + pacman + pamac-aur + aurman + pikaur +  kalu +with the respective notifiers and use as default deepin as your wm.. This 'll made You happy!
#
pacman -S pacaur
#
pacman -S yaourt
#
pacman -S octopi
#
pacman -S pamac
#
pacman -S xorg xorg-server
#
pacman -S deepin
#
pacman -S deepin-extra
#
systemctl start lightdm.service
#
systemctl enable lightdm.service
#
systemctl status lightdm.service
#
pacman -S gnome gnome-extra
#
systemctl enable gdm.service
#
systemctl start gdm.service
#
systemctl status gdm.service
#
reboot

#Choose deepin as your window manager in the left down corner from the list and login with the 2nd account that you created (no with root)

#Now install telegram
#
pacman -S telegram-desktop
#
#
Done finished the installation of this impressive distro. 
#
#
#
#
#
#

## From this point in advance your mind need be inspired...
